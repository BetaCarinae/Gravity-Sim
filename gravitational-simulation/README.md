# Gravitational Simulation

This project is a simple gravitational simulation created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It visualizes the gravitational interactions between multiple bodies in a 2D space.

## Features

- Simulates gravitational attraction between bodies.
- Interactive canvas where users can add new bodies by clicking.
- Displays the trajectory of each body as it moves under the influence of gravity.

## Getting Started

To run the simulation, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable):
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Open the `index.html` file** in your web browser. You can simply double-click the file or open it through your browser's file menu.

3. **Interact with the simulation**:
   - Click anywhere on the canvas to add a new gravitational body.
   - Observe how the bodies interact with each other based on their mass and distance.

## Requirements

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.) that supports HTML5 and JavaScript.
