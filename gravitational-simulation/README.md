# Gravitational Simulation

This project is a simple gravitational simulation built entirely in HTML and JavaScript. It simulates the motion of celestial bodies under the influence of gravitational forces.

## Project Structure

```

├── index.html        # Main HTML document for the simulation
├── src
│   ├── main.js      # Main JavaScript file for simulation logic
│   └── utils.js     # Utility functions for calculations
├── styles

└── README.md        # Documentation for the project
```

## Getting Started

To run the simulation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd gravitational-simulation
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Dependencies

This project does not have any external dependencies. It uses standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

The simulation includes:

- **Celestial Bodies**: Objects representing planets, stars, or other celestial entities.
- **Gravitational Calculations**: Functions to calculate the gravitational force between bodies and update their positions based on these forces.
- **Rendering**: A canvas to visually represent the motion of the celestial bodies.

## Usage

- You can modify the parameters in `src/main.js` to change the number of celestial bodies or their initial conditions.
- The simulation can be paused or reset by implementing additional controls in the HTML file.
