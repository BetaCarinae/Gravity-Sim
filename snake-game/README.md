# Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is designed to be played in a web browser and is fully contained within a single HTML file.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the direction of the snake.
3. The objective of the game is to eat the food that appears on the canvas. Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer.
4. Avoid running into the walls or into yourself, as this will end the game.
5. The game will keep track of your score, which increases with each food item consumed.

## Additional Notes

- The game is implemented using the HTML5 `<canvas>` element for rendering the game graphics.
- The JavaScript code handles the game logic, including snake movement, food generation, and collision detection.
- You can modify the game by changing the speed of the snake, the size of the canvas, or the appearance of the snake and food.

Enjoy playing the Snake game!
